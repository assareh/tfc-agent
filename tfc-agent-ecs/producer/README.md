# Terraform Cloud Agent in Amazon ECS Producer Workspace

Provide values for required variables. Please note that I have the resource utilization of the tfc-agent containers set to the bare minimum of 128 CPU units and 256MB of RAM. This can be increased in the [task definition](files/task_definition.json) for improved performance. 

This workspace will require AWS credentials of some sort. A Terraform Cloud Agent token must also be provided as the terraform input variable `tfc_agent_token`.

I've included helper scripts to create and delete an agent token, however you can always create and manage these in the Terraform Cloud organization Settings.

`./files/create_tfc_agent_token.sh` will create an agent token and output the token value and token id. You must provide a Terraform Cloud organization or admin user token as the environment variable `TOKEN`. You must also provide your Terraform Cloud organization name as an argument.

```
→ ./files/create_tfc_agent_token.sh hashidemos
{
  "agent_token": "bpcqFQzBtu42qQ.atlasv1.3l7au3dmF8FQw8VNhJl2puzn0jlIF1zWn9zJPPs0s9q04KnzlKjWyUCvhpm3ALKUzf8",
  "agent_token_id": "at-VkQxdEWdPDeGEXd3"
}

Save agent_token_id for use in deletion script. Tokens can always be deleted from the Terraform Cloud Settings page.
```

`./files/delete_tfc_agent_token.sh` will delete an agent token with the specified agent token id. You must provide a Terraform Cloud organization or admin user token as the environment variable `TOKEN`. You must also provide the agent token id as an argument.

```
→ ./files/delete_tfc_agent_token.sh at-VkQxdEWdPDeGEXd3

## Autoscaling tfc-agent with a Lambda Function
I've included a Lambda function that, when combined with [Terraform Cloud notifications](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/workspaces/notifications.html), enables autoscaling the number of Terraform Cloud Agents running.

![notification_config](./files/notification_config.png)

To use it, you'll need to:
1. Configure the `desired_count` and `max_count` Terraform variables as desired. `desired_count` sets the baseline number of agents to always be running. `max_count` sets the maximum number of agents allowed to be running at one time.

2. Configure a [generic notification](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/workspaces/notifications.html#creating-a-notification-configuration) on each Terraform Cloud workspace that will be using an agent (workspace [execution mode](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/workspaces/settings.html#execution-mode) set to `Agent`). I've included a helper script that will create them for you, however you can always create and manage these in the Terraform Cloud workspace Settings. You could also use the [Terraform Enterprise provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe/latest/docs).

That's it! When a run is queued, Terraform Cloud will send a notification to the Lambda function, increasing the number of running agents. When the run is completed, Terraform Cloud will send another notification to the Lambda function, decreasing the number of running agents.

Note: [Speculative Plans](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/run/index.html#speculative-plans) do not trigger this autoscaling.

### Add Notification to Workspaces script

`./files/add_notification_to_workspaces.sh` will add the notification configuration to one or more workspaces in the organization specified. You must provide: 
1. a Terraform Cloud organization or admin user token as the environment variable `TOKEN`.
2. the notification token you've configured (Terraform variable `notification_token`) as the environment variable `HMAC_SALT`.
3. the workspace(s) to which you'd like to add the notification configuration.
4. the webhook URL output from Terraform.

Example usage:
```
→ ./files/add_notification_to_workspaces.sh hashidemos andys-lab https://h8alki27g6.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/test
```

Here's an example usage with the [TFE provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe/latest/docs):
```
resource "tfe_notification_configuration" "agent_lambda_webhook" {
 name                      = "tfc-agent"
 enabled                   = true
 destination_type          = "generic"
 triggers                  = ["run:created", "run:completed", "run:errored"]
 url                       = data.terraform_remote_state.tfc-agent-ecs-producer.outputs.webhook_url
 workspace_external_id     = tfe_workspace.test.id
}
```
