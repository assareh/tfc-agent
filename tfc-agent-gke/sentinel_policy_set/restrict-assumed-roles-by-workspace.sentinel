# This policy restricts accounts that can be assumed by the AWS provider.
# It includes a map that maps roles to lists of regex expressions
# that match one or more workspace names

# It can only determine the role_arn if it is set to either a hard-coded value
# or to a reference to a single Terraform variable.
# If you want to the policy to pass if the assumed role contains a single
# non-variable reference or if it finds multiple references, then include a role
# called "complex" in the allowed_roles map and associate it with workspaces.
